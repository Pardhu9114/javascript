git-hub(cloud)
local repo----untracked files , tracked files
un-t-->create update delete
tracked ---->git add file-name or git add . and git commit -m

repository-> Folder

git remote add origin http-path---> Establishing the path in the local repo

git push -u origin master/main--->here main is the default 

origin is nothing but git-hub

WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT?
It is used to convert static page into dynamic page 
DEVELOP THE DYNAMIC WEBSITES
Static is fixed and remains same for everyone
Ex: fb login.
Dynamic changes from person to person based on the conditions of the user
Ex: youtube, maps, Instagram etc…
DATA TYPES 
	PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE :
Num, string, Boolean, undefined, bigint
	NON PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE : 
Class, object, array, functions, map, sets

In JS variables are dynamic in nature, which means no need of declaring the data type while assigning a value to variable.
In java variables are static.
In JS we have SCOPE  concept 
Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript
They are of 3 types:
Global scope – declare outside and access it in inside the block
Local scope/ Script scope  - Variables declared within a JavaScript function
Block scope - Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block

IN JS DATA TYPES THEY ARE DIVIDED INTO 3 :
VAR
LET
CONST

First preference for “const” then “let” then “var”
In const reinitialization and redeclaration is not possible
In let reinitialization is possible
In var both are possible

VARIABLES:
	Static typed and dynamic types
	They are used to store the data(any kind of data)
	Case – sensitive 
	Allow  letters ,_ $(dollar sign) [variables can be started by using these]
	Variables cant start with numbers
	Reserved words(Key words)  are also not allowed

How to declare varbles?
	Var keyword (1995-2015)
	Let keyword 2015
	Var used only in old browsers

1)	Reassigning variables is possible by var
It will be taking latest assigned values
2)	Reassigning variables is possible by let
3)	Reassigning variables is not possible by const






VAR :
 
 

OUTPUT : 


Ex 2:
 
OUTPUT : 
 



Reassigning with LET keyword :
 
Output: 
 
Reassigning with CONST : 
 
Output : 
 	 







REDECLARING : 
VAR : 
         
OUTPUT : 
 

LET : 
         
Output : 
 

CONST : 
 

Output : 
 

Here ,
Redeclaration with var is accepted
Redeclaration with let is not accepted 
Redeclaration with const is not accepted 

BLOCK SCOPE : 
Variables declared with 
VAR : 
 
Output: 
 

LET :
  



Output :
 
 
CONST :l 
 
OUTPUT :

Two types of data types in JS : 
-	Primitive 
-	Non-primitive : objects, arrays
TO CHECK THE DATA TYPE – TYPE OF:
1)	Primitive data type : predefined : we can store single values
2)	Numbers : integers, floats
3)	String : Stream of characters, enclosed in quotes ( single , double, backtick quotes)
4)	Boolean : true or false
5)	Null : empty or no value
6)	Undefined : declared variable with no value

Strings : Stream of characters enclosed in quotes
it will provides a functionality

#Loops :

Conditional statements : 
To make the set of instructions execute only when the conditional id True Block of Code (conditional block) set of instructions
When this block of code will execute when the specific condition is true or false based on the condition.
Indentation : { }
The code used or written inside the indentation can be considered as the block code OR conditional block

Eg : {       
           ------ block code 
                                           }
